# EPA Firm Pollution Investigation Project

This data task was completed to illustrate my capability in data analysis to an internship application with the Environment and Energy Lab at the University of Chicago. Specifically, this project summarizes my ability in data cleaning, creating summary tables, running regressions (logistic), and intepreting the results. In addition, the project also covers causal inference through difference in difference techniques and randomized control trials. 

The responses.ipynb notebook contains most of the code and directions for the project. Unclean.csv, outcome.csv, and data_descripton.xlsx are the initial raw datasets and cleaned.csv is the final cleaned dataset (also seen in responses notebook).
