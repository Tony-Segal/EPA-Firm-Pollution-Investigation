# EPA Firm Pollution Investigation

This project summarizes my ability in data cleaning, creating summary tables, running regressions (logistic), and intepreting the results. In addition, the project also covers causal inference through difference in difference techniques and randomized control trials. The responses.ipynb notebook contains most of the code and directions for the project. Unclean.csv, outcome.csv, and data_descripton.xlsx are the initial raw datasets and cleaned.csv is the final cleaned dataset (also seen in responses notebook). All guidance and data was provided by the University of Chicago, Energy and Environment Lab
